            <p>
                Punjabi food is wholesome and full of rustic flavour. The custom of cooking in community ovens or
                tandoors prevails in rural pockets even today. The cuisine is characterised by a profusion of dairy
                products in the form of malai, paneer and dahi. The dals are a speciality of this type of cuisine, made
                of whole pulses like black gram, green gram and Bengal gram. They are cooked on slow fire, often
                simmered for hours till they turn creamy and then flavoured with spices and rounded off with malai for
                that rich finish. The food is simply delicious.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                The most unique thing about cooking in a tandoor is the smoky flavour that the food gets making it
                tastier. Moreover it is a healthy way of cooking since minimum fat is required and the food generally
                gets cooked in its own juices thus retaining its natural flavours. Besides it is not only easy to
                digest, it is also very hygienic. In conclusion one can safely say that it is through tandoori cooking
                that Indian cuisine first got globally acknowledged.

                Biryani is a classic Indian mixed rice dish that is part of the Indian Mughlai culinary tradition, which
                traces its roots to central Asian cuisine and a rich fusion with Indian flavors and techniques. It is
                prepared with layers of fluffy basmati rice and exquisitely spiced meat or chicken.
            </p>

                    <li>1 teaspoon saffron ground and dissolved in 2 tablespoon hot water</li>
                </ul>
        
        
            <h2>Method</h2>
        
            <h3>Fried Onions</h3>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Heat oil at medium high in a wide frying pan.
                </li>
                <li>Fry onions in batches. Do not crowd the pan. Fry until crisp light golden brown.

                <li>
                    Remove and drin from oil and set aside
                </li>
            </ol>
            </p>
        
            <h3>Chicken Marination</h3>
            <p>
                Combine chicken with all marinade ingredients and ⅓ of fried onions.
                TIP: Add yogurt, starting with ½ cup and increase as needed to ¾ cup. The mixture should be thick and
                not runny.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Grind biryani spices in a spice grinder. Add to chicken marinade and combine. Marinate for about 3 to 5
                hours.
        
            </p>
        
            <h3>Rice Prep</h3>
        
            <p>
                Rinse rice 4 to 5 times in lots of water until it is clear. Drain well. Soak ⅓ cup basmati rice in water
                for one hour. Save the rest.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Bring 2¼ cups of water to a rolling boil in a rice cooker. Add ¾ teaspoon salt, 1½ tablespoons olive oil
                and whole spices. Then add remaining 1⅔ cups basmati rice and stir. Let it cook just until all the water
                is absorbed.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                It is important to NOT let the rice steam until it is fully done. Just when all the water is well
                absorbed, transfer cooked rice immediately to another wide open pan. In my rice cooker the whole process
                takes about 15 to 20 minutes.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Assembly</h3>
            <p>
                Transfer chicken with marinade to a 4 to 5 quart wide thick bottomed oven proof cooking pot (9 to 10
                inch diameter). Make sure there is not too much marinade around chicken pieces and that it is not runny.
                Scatter cilantro, mint, half the lemon juice and ½ tablespoon olive oil over the chicken/marinade. Then
                scatter most of the fried onions.
                Drain the soaked basmati rice very well and spread it over the fried onion layer. (This raw soaked rice
                will get cooked with the juices from chicken).
                Next, layer all the cooked rice. Top with remaining lemon juice, saffron water, fried onions and ghee.
                TIP: If you prefer, you may pick out the whole spices from cooked rice before steaming.
        
            </p>
        
            <h3>Final Steaming</h3>
            <p>
                Place one sheet of parchment paper, followed by one to two sheets of aluminum foil over the cooking pot.
                Place the lid tight over it. Bake biryani in a preheated oven at 350ºF for one hour, until steam builds
                up well.
                Alternatively, it can be cooked on a stove in a thick bottomed cooking pot. Heat the biryani at medium
                high for about 10 to 15 minutes and then reduce to low and cook for one hour until steam builds up well.
                Let it cool five minutes and gently mix rice and chicken. Using a spatula mound the biryani on a serving
                plate, making sure to present the rice in various colors - white, yellow, orange and brown. Place some
                chicken pieces on the top. Scatter browned onions, chopped herbs and extra saffron rice on top.
                Serve chicken biryani with Hyderabadi tomato egg curry and/or raita prepared with creamy yogurt, chopped
                red onions, deseeded jalapenos and cilantro.
